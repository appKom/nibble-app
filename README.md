# Nibbel app

## Environtment variables

To run the app with login and fetching inventory data, a set of env variables are needed. They are:

```
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=
REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=
REAT_APP_API_BASE=
REAT_APP_OW_AUTHORITY=
REACT_APP_URL= or DEPLOY_URL= (injected by Netlify)
```

They should be in a `.env` file, which is placed in the root of the application.
To get the respective variables, you should contact one of the developers.
